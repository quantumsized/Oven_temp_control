# Oven_temp_control
I shall post a circuit diagram just as soon as I can.
I have only just finished this ans as such it is open to the pit-falls. It is untested with full hardware due to that I am waiting on the MAX6675 breakout board to arrive.
I will post an update if needed after complete test.

Tho not needed, I used a mini breadboard as a method of mounting the Arduino Nano.
In addition, I used a piece of Polycarbonate 1/4 inch thick and about 3 inches by 6 inches.
My LCD display is mounted with 3/4 inch tall stand-offs.
I am yet to build a full encasement but that is the next step after making sure all is working to my satisfaction.

A complete parts list will be posted here at some point but the basics are mentioned in the core files (INO and C files).

I will also post a picture of my make-up of this project at some point.

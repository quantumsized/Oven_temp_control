# Oven Temperature Control
This name may be a bit misleading cuase it actually thermally controls a gas valve.

/*****
Please note that this is not for controlling a pilot light or any electronic igniter and as such it does not have any safety control in place to make sure there is something to ignite the gas when it is released by the electronic valve used in this project.

I shall post a circuit diagram just as soon as I can.
I have only just finished this ans as such it is open to the pit-falls. It is untested with full hardware due to that I am waiting on the MAX6675 breakout board to arrive.
I will post an update if needed after complete test.

Tho not needed, I used a mini breadboard as a method of mounting the Arduino Nano.
In addition, I used a piece of Polycarbonate 1/4 inch thick and about 3 inches by 6 inches.
My LCD display is mounted with 3/4 inch tall stand-offs.
I am yet to build a full encasement but that is the next step after making sure all is working to my satisfaction.

Here is a list of parts as similar to what I am using as can be:

1 - 16 x 2 LCD display with serial adaptor

1 - Arduino Nano or similar

1 - mini bread board

1 - Gas propane 12 volt electric valve (about $16 USD); http://www.ebay.com/itm/261887206478

1 - bi-color led for indication of state (on/off) and heater state

1 - peizo buzzer

1 - rotary encoder

1 - LM7805 positive voltage regulator

1 - 2SA733 PNP transistor

1 - PC123 optoisolator (is almost the same as PC817)

1 - STP60NF06 N-CHANNEL 60V 0.014 OHM 60A TO-220 STRIPFET POWER MOSFET

1 - 500mA fuse

6 - 1/8 watt through-hole carbon film resistors

  2 @ 100 ohm

  1 @ 1 k ohm

  1 @ 3k3 ohm

  1 @ 4k7 ohm


I do my electronics parts look-up through these guys: http://www.datasheetcatalog.com/
They have one of the largest selections and if you just search, it is the simplest to navigate.
As for other parts such as mini breadboards, LCD displays, rotary encoders, and arduino tech, I use http://www.ebay.com/ for those.
This would also be true for LEDs and LED strips.
The other small components such as resistors, fuses, peizo buzzers, optoisolators, small signal transistors, and voltage regulators, I get those from other small electronics I have disassembled.
I purchased my STP60NF06 N-FET from Mouser Electronics: http://www.mouser.com/

I will also post a picture of my make-up of this project at some point.
